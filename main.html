	<h1>HTML Document Creation: Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size, providing an estimate of how the execution time grows and is efficicent with larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> quantifies the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run to completion as a function of the input size.space complexity is also expressed using Big O notation, with examples such as O(1) for constant space, O(n) for linear space, and O(nÂ²) for quadratic space</p>
